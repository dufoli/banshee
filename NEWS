===============================================================================
NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.8 is a stable release, the culmination of six month's work by 67
    programmers, artists, documentation writers, and translators.  These
    notes aggregate the highlights from the 1.7 development releases.

    New Features Since 1.6:

      * Integrated AmazonMP3 Store

            Browse, search, preview, buy, and download music straight into
            your Banshee library from the US, UK, FR, DE, and JP AmazonMP3
            stores.  See http://abock.org/2010/07/13/amazon-mp3-store-in-banshee

      * Miro Guide Podcast Directory

            Browse and subscribe to thousands of audio and video podcasts
            listed on the non-profit run MiroGuide.com.

      * Improved Apple Device Support

            iPhone, iTouch, iPad, and iPod devices are now supported via the
            awesome libgpod library.

      * Revamped Hardware Backend

            Uses the latest Linux hardware stack, a combination of GIO, udev, and
            media-player-info files, to provide support for CDs and
            digital audio players.

      * Keybinding for Switching Sources

          Typing 'g' activates the source switcher, where you can type the name
          of a source to switch to it.  You can type its acronym or a substring
          as well. As soon as only one source matches, it will be activated.
          For example, you can type 'g' and then 'np' to switch to Now Playing.

      * Improved Audiobook Support

          The Audiobooks library is now enabled by default, and audiobook
          tracks are now better organized into books.  The last position in
          each book is automatically saved, so you can resume playing a book
          right from where you stopped.

      * User Manual

            Available via Help Â» Contents menu and F1.  Uses the latest
            GNOME documentation technology, Mallard.

      * Bulk Metadata Fixer

            New extension for bulk metadata fixing to merge artists, albums,
            and genres that vary only by case, '&' vs 'and', etc.

      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1

      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.
