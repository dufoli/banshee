Translators, intltool-update currently fails on a fresh Banshee git clone. The
reason for this is that src/Hyena is in fact a git submodule.

To fix the issue please run:

% git submodule init
% git submodule update

The final solution to this problem is creating l10n infrastructure for the Hyena
project which will happen some time after 1.8 release. See also bgo#629406.
